# EJSnow.github.io
Just a little website of mine.

The actual website is not in the `main` branch, instead it's hosted over at the `gh-pages` branch. To view the website like a normal person, navigate to [https://EJSnow.github.io](https://ejsnow.github.io). If you want to make your own website using the same style, you can download the template from [here](https://templated.co/linear). I rewrote the underlying CSS to be much simpler, and also found out that I can just remove all the JavaScript. I also changed the color scheme to blue.

If you see anything in the source code you would have done better, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/EJSnow/EJSnow.github.io/issues) so we can discuss it.
