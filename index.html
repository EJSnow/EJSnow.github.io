					<p>Hey! My name is Ezra Snow, sometimes known as LightSaber online (mainly in video games). I live in North Carolina, and I'm homeschooled. I'm currently a junior in highschool. I'm 16 years old, and I enjoy computers and computer gaming. My favorite color is blue, because it's an amazing color.</p>
					<p>This site probably won't have much on it for now. Mostly just occasional computer related projects. I'll probably expand it later, as I learn more about programming and computers.</p>

					<h2 class="center-align">About me</h2>
					<p>My name is Ezra Snow. I live in North Carolina. I'm 16, homeschooled, and a junior in highschool.</p>
					<p>I LOVE working with computers. I probably spend a little too much time on my computer, lol. I love learning about all the different parts of a computer, and how upgrading different parts affects how my computer works.</p>
					<p>As part of that, I have inevitably gotten into programming. I made this website from scratch with the <a href="https://materializecss.com">Materialize</a> framework. (So not really from scratch, but sort of.) It was pretty cool to develop. The framework hasn't been updated in some time, but it still works perfectly fine in Firefox 128 ESR.</p>
					<p>After I finish high school, I plan on majoring in computer science in college and then after that, I want to do something computer science/IT related.</p>
					<p>My favorites:</p>
					<ul class="browser-default">
						<li>Favorite color: Blue</li>
						<li>Favorite operating system: Windows 7 (<a target="_blank" href="https://getaurora.dev">Aurora Linux</a> is a close second, Windows 10 is a distant third)</li>
						<li>Favorite computer type: Early 2010s laptops (because they're upgradable <i>and</i> portable)</li>
						<li>Favorite hobbies: Computer gaming and programming</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I am a follower of Jesus Christ. I believe that God made us as good people, but we chose to turn away from him and live in sin, and that everyone has sinned. As sinners, we are doomed to die. But God in his mercy sent Jesus to live on earth, and die for our sins. But Jesus rose from the dead, and has returned to be with God our Father. In doing this, God opened a way for us to know him personally. If we come to the Father through Jesus and repent of our sins, we will be saved from death, and we will be able to live forever with God. If you are reading this, and you aren't currently in a relationship with God, I encourage you to find a church wherever you live, and to learn about God through Scripture.</p>
