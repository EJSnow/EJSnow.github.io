# EJSnow.github.io
Just a little website of mine.

The actual website is not in the `main` branch, instead it's hosted over at the `gh-pages` branch. To view the website like a normal person, navigate to [https://EJSnow.github.io](https://ejsnow.github.io).

If you see anything in the source code you would have done better, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/EJSnow/EJSnow.github.io/issues) so we can discuss it.

This website is based on the [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) UI framework. The Materialize code (found in `css/materialize.min.css` and `js/materialize.min.js` uses the MIT license. The glyph icons are Google's [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) in the Outlined style and use the Apache 2.0 license. All other content is owned by me. (Except the under construction image, I found that on Google. It's unlicensed I think.)
