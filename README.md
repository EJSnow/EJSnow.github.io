# EJSnow.github.io
Just a little website of mine. Go here to learn about me, my projects, and other stuff.

The actual website is not in the `main` branch, instead it's hosted over at the `gh-pages` branch. To view the website like a normal person, navigate to [https://EJSnow.github.io](https://ejsnow.github.io).
## Getting the website source code
If you want to make your own website using the same style, you can download the template from [here](https://templated.co/linear). I modified the template's stylesheet significantly to 1) self host fonts and upgrade the Font Awesome icon font to V5 (cause I needed an icon only available in that version or newer), 2) to tweak the appearance somewhat. If you want to make a website with the exact same style as mine, I recommend cloning the `gh-pages` branch of this repository, then replacing all the images with your own and changing the content to suit your intentions.

If you see anything in the source code you would have done better, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/EJSnow/EJSnow.github.io/issues) so we can discuss it.
